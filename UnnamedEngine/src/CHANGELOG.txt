Hello. This is a whole new game engine which has even more
changes than Andor 2. Firstly it is written in C++, which so
far has proven much better for this purpose due to not having
garbage collection which previously caused quite jagged frame
rates. This was not the only reason for doing this, as after
spending several years using Java, I thought it would a good
change.

This obviously means that there are many things that could be
improved at the current time.

Here are the list of current libraries being used:
- GLFW
- GLEW
- Assimp
- stb_image

This means that many model and image formats are now
supported, however since C++ does not have as much cross
compatibility, for the time being, there will not be any
other platforms supported other than Windows, but this
doesn't matter much as this is mainly a set of experiments.

As this is the first entry, there are not many changes here.

* Models now use interleaved VBOs
